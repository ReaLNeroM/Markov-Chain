This is a Markov Chain algorithm implemented in C++. 
It is fast enough for most non-commercial use cases. More quantitatively, it processes the 25 most popular Project Gutenberg files in 10 seconds on a notebook i7 processor. The program does not use multiple threads.

To aid in processing Facebook messages (downloadable from Facebook settings->Download a copy of your data), build.sh also cleans the message data automatically (with a bit of help from you). 
The facebook archive's messages/ folder should be provided in a folder called input/. The build.sh script then enumerates the html files in a sequential order for easier processing, analyzes the html files for messages you've written using regex, and then dumps your messages as .txt files in a folder called output/. 
After this process of data cleaning, Markov Chain.cpp is compiled, and generates a Markov model based on your messages. The Markov model then prints out some sample sentences, which should sound eerily close to the way you talk.

If confused, do the following:
0) fix the dependencies listed below
1) download your facebook data archive, and place the messages directory in a folder called input/
2) run build.sh, and follow the instructions

Dependencies: C++11, PHP, python
